                    <summary>Show Explanation and Correct Answer</summary>
                    <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> False. The energy generated by the ionization of a single atom (approximately 35 eV) is significantly greater than the energy of a covalent bond in a DNA strand (around 4 eV), indicating it is sufficient to cause such damage.</p>
                </details>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 2 -->
            <div class="question" data-correct-answer="True">
                <p>2. Cluster ionization events, which cause significant damage at the atomic scale, are most common when alpha particles interact with tissue compared to beta particles or gamma/X-rays.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary>Show Explanation and Correct Answer</summary>
                    <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> True. Ionization events, often known as clusters, are common when alpha particles interact with tissue, less common when beta particles interact, and rare when gamma or X-rays interact with tissue.</p>
                </details>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 3 -->
            <div class="question" data-correct-answer="False">
                <p>3. The absorbed dose, measured in grays (Gy), is the primary quantity used in medical imaging applications, where doses are generally of the order of Sv or mSv.</p>
                <label><input type="radio" name="q3" value="True"> True</label>

                <details>
                    <summary>Show Explanation and Correct Answer</summary>
                    <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> False. The absorbed dose is measured in grays (Gy), but in medical imaging applications, the doses encountered are generally of the order of mGy or Î¼Gy, not Sv or mSv. Equivalent dose (Sv) and effective dose (Sv) are calculated parameters related to biological effectiveness and risk, respectively.</p>
                </details>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 4 -->
            <div class="question" data-correct-answer="False">
                <p>4. Cell survival curves typically show that more cells are killed per unit dose at low dose rates, as this allows for cumulative damage to overwhelm tissue repair mechanisms.</p>
                <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="True"> True</label>
                <label><input type="radio" name="q4" value="False"> False</label>

                <details>
                    <summary>Show Explanation and Correct Answer</summary>
                    <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> False. At **high** dose rates, cumulative damage defeats tissue repair mechanisms, making cell death more likely to occur. Therefore, more cells are killed per unit dose at **high** dose rates [101, 102f]. At low dose rates, tissue repair mechanisms can repair DNA damage prior to the next exposure.</p>
                </details>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 5 -->
            <div class="question" data-correct-answer="True">
                <p>5. Fractionation, the delivery of high doses into numerous smaller fractions with fixed time intervals, is utilized in radiotherapy to maximize tumor killing while sparing damage to surrounding healthy tissues, as healthy tissues generally have more effective repair mechanisms than tumors.</p>
                <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="True"> True</label>
                <label><input type="radio" name="q5" value="False"> False</label>
                <div class="feedback"></div>
                <details>
                    <summary>Show Explanation and Correct Answer</summary>
                    <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> True. The distribution of a high dose into numerous smaller fractions delivered with fixed time intervals between them, known as fractionation, allows for tissue repair to occur between exposures. This can be utilised in radiotherapy to maximize tumour killing while sparing damage to surrounding healthy tissues, as healthy tissues generally have more effective repair mechanisms than tumors.</p>
                </details>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 6 -->
            <div class="question" data-correct-answer="False">
                <p>6. The effective dose to a patient can be directly measured using devices like the dose-area product (DAP) meter for X-ray examinations, providing a highly accurate individual patient exposure assessment.</p>
                <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="True"> True</label>
                <label><input type="radio" name="q6" value="False"> False</label>
                <div class="feedback"></div>
                <details>
                    <summary>Show Explanation and Correct Answer</summary>
                    <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> False. The effective dose can only be **computed**; it cannot be measured directly. Mathematical modeling techniques are used to derive coefficients that enable organ doses to be calculated using measurable quantities like DAP for X-ray examinations, but there are uncertainties in the modeling, leading to a relative accuracy of around Â±50% for any individual patient exposure.</p>
                </details>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 7 -->
            <div class="question" data-correct-answer="True">
                <p>7. For diagnostic radiological procedures, the three main tenets of radiation protection guidance (justification, optimization, and dose limits) all apply, including dose limits for the patient.</p>
                <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="True"> True</label>
                <label><input type="radio" name="q7" value="False"> False</label>
                <div class="feedback"></div>
                <details>
                    <summary>Show Explanation and Correct Answer</summary>
                    <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> False. While justification and optimization (ALARP) apply to patient exposures, dose limits **do not apply to patients** undergoing medical exposures, or to those looking after them (carers and comforters). Patient exposures are minimized through diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) and optimization, not dose limits.</p>
                </details>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 8 -->
            <div class="question" data-correct-answer="False">
                <p>8. The dose to staff and the public is primarily due to stochastic effects, which are immediately observable following high-dose exposures, such as erythema or radiation sickness.</p>
                <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="True"> True</label>
                <label><input type="radio" name="q8" value="False"> False</label>
                <div class="feedback"></div>
                <details>
                    <summary>Show Explanation and Correct Answer</summary>
                    <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> False. Erythema and radiation sickness are **deterministic effects**, which occur rapidly (hours to weeks) after exposure to high doses [110, 112t, 113t]. Stochastic effects, such as cancer induction, occur many years after exposure, if at all, and their probability increases with dose. The dose to staff and the public is managed to prevent stochastic effects, which is why dose limits are set.</p>
                </details>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 9 -->
            <div class="question" data-correct-answer="True">
                <p>9. The Inverse Square Law is a fundamental principle in practical radiation protection, stating that doubling the distance from a radiation source reduces the dose to one-quarter.</p>
                <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="True"> True</label>
                <label><input type="radio" name="q9" value="False"> False</label>
                <div class="feedback"></div>
                <details>
                    <summary>Show Explanation and Correct Answer</summary>
                    <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> True. The Inverse Square Law states that radiation dose decreases with the square of the distance from a point source. Therefore, if you double the distance, the dose drops to one-quarter. This is one of the three principles of practical radiation protection, along with time and shielding.</p>
                </details>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 10 -->
            <div class="question" data-correct-answer="False">
                <p>10. Under the Ionising Radiation Regulations (IRR) 2017, the Radiation Protection Supervisor (RPS) is legally responsible for advising the employer on how to comply with the regulations and must hold a certificate of competence from an approved body like RPA 2000.</p>
                <label><input type="radio" name="q10" value="True"> True</label>

                    <summary>Show Explanation and Correct Answer</summary>
                    <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> False. The employer must appoint a **Radiation Protection Adviser (RPA)** to advise them on how to comply with the regulations. The RPA must hold a certificate of competence from an approved body (RPA 2000 in the UK). The **RPS** is responsible for ensuring that the local rules are followed in practical terms within their area of responsibility.</p>
                </details>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 11 -->
            <div class="question" data-correct-answer="True">
                <p>11. The Ionising Radiation (Medical Exposure) Regulations (IR(ME)R) 2017 apply to all medical exposures, including those carried out for health screening, medical research, and even non-medical exposures using medical radiological equipment.</p>
                <label><input type="radio" name="q11" value="True"> True</label>

                    <summary>Show Explanation and Correct Answer</summary>
                    <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> True. IR(ME)R 2017 is the fundamental legislation for protecting the patient. It covers diagnostic and therapeutic medical exposures, health screening exposures, medical research exposures, exposures of carers and comforters, exposures of asymptomatic persons, and non-medical exposures carried out using medical radiological equipment.</p>
                </details>
            </div>

            <!-- Question 12 -->
            <div class="question" data-correct-answer="False">
                <p>12. Under IR(ME)R 2017, the "Operator" is primarily responsible for justifying all medical exposures, ensuring that the benefit to the patient outweighs the radiation detriment.</p>

                    <summary>Show Explanation and Correct Answer</summary>
                    <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> False. Under IR(ME)R, the **Practitioner** is required to justify all medical exposures. The **Operator** is responsible for the optimization of the exposures and can authorise exposures if following written guidance from a practitioner and appropriately entitled.</p>
                </details>

            <!-- Question 13 -->
            <div class="question" data-correct-answer="True">
                <p>13. A "Medical Physics Expert" (MPE) is required to be appointed by the employer for all areas involving medical exposures, and their scope of practice must be formally certificated through a scheme administered by RPA 2000.</p>

                    <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> True. Incidents, including accidental or unintended exposures, should be investigated immediately. Depending on the magnitude, they may be deemed SAUE or Clinically Significant Accidental or Unintended Exposure (CSAUE), requiring reporting to regulatory bodies, and the patient must always be appropriately informed under the duty of candour.</p>

An area must be designated as a controlled area if anyone working in the area is likely to receive an effective dose greater than 6 mSv per year or if any person entering or working in the area is required to follow special procedures to mitigate against significant exposure to ionising radiation or reduce the likelihood or severity of radiation accidents.</p>

                <p>18. According to the ICRP's linear-no threshold (LNT) model, there is a clear threshold dose below which there is no risk of cancer induction from radiation exposure, supporting the concept of a safe dose.</p>

                    <summary>Show Explanation and Correct Answer</summary>
                    <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> False. The LNT model, recommended by the ICRP, **implies that there is no safe dose of radiation**, which contradicts evidence of a threshold dose (100-200 mSv) from atomic bomb data. The model suggests that any dose, no matter how small, carries some risk, with the risk increasing in an almost linear fashion for solid tumours above certain thresholds.</p>

                    <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> True. It is a duty of the pregnant employee to notify their employer in writing as soon as they have confirmed their pregnancy or if they are breastfeeding when they return to work. The employer is then responsible for ensuring the equivalent dose to the foetus is less than 1 mSv for the remainder of the pregnancy, and for considering risks to the breastfeeding infant.</p>

However, around **2.3 mSv of this is from natural sources** in the environment (cosmic, terrestrial, radon, food), and the remainder is from medical exposures.</p>
