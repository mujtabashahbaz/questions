Write full HTML code for a self-contained 20-question True/False quiz based on *Farr's Physics for Medical Imaging, 3rd edition – Chapter 1*, using a dark theme.

Use !DOCTYPE html with full html, head, and body structure.

In the head, include:

meta charset, meta viewport, title
 
A style block with:
Black background, white/light-gray text
Clean sans-serif font
Centered layout, rounded corners, soft shadows
Hover effects for buttons
Feedback in green/red/blue (readable on black)

In the body:
A div class="quiz-container" with a h1 and intro p
A form id="quizForm" with 20 questions, each inside:

div class="question" data-correct-answer="True/False"
A p for question text
Two radio inputs with labels for True and False
A hidden div class="feedback" that appears after selection
A closed details with:

summary: “Show Explanation and Correct Answer”
 
p showing:
Correct answer
Whether user was right
Brief explanation
Optional span class="citation" for book reference

At the bottom:
A div class="button-container" with one Reset Quiz button (id="resetQuiz")

Behavior:
Selecting an answer shows feedback and expands explanation for that question only.
No “Check Answers” button — feedback appears after a choice is made.
